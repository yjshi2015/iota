//!
//! ## Graceful shutdown
//!
//! The shutdown sequence in the data ingestion system ensures clean termination
//! of all components while preserving data integrity. It is initiated via a
//! [CancellationToken](tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken), which triggers a
//! hierarchical and graceful shutdown process.
//!
//! The shutdown process follows a top-down hierarchy:
//! 1. [`Worker`]: Individual workers within a [`WorkerPool`] detect the
//!    cancellation signal, completes current checkpoint processing, sends final
//!    progress updates and signals completion to parent [`WorkerPool`] via
//!    `WorkerStatus::Shutdown` message.
//! 2. [`WorkerPool`]: Coordinates worker shutdowns, ensures all progress
//!    messages are processed, waits for all workers' shutdown signals and
//!    notifies [`IndexerExecutor`] with `WorkerPoolStatus::Shutdown` message
//!    when fully terminated.
//! 3. [`IndexerExecutor`]: Orchestrates the shutdown of all worker pools and
//!    and finalizes system termination.

/// Processes individual checkpoints and produces messages for optional batch

///
/// The Worker trait defines the core processing logic for checkpoint data.
/// Workers run in parallel within a [`WorkerPool`] to process checkpoints and
/// generate messages that can optionally be batched and processed by a
/// [`Reducer`].
///
/// # Processing Modes
///
/// Workers support two processing modes:
/// * **Direct Processing**: Messages are handled immediately without batching.
/// * **Batch Processing**: Messages are accumulated and processed in batches by
///   a [`Reducer`].
///
/// The processing mode is determined by the presence of a [`Reducer`] in the
/// [`WorkerPool`] configuration.
///
/// # Concurrency
///
/// Multiple instances of a worker can run in parallel in the worker pool. The
/// implementation must be thread-safe and handle checkpoint processing
/// efficiently.
///
/// # Integration with Optional Reducer
///
/// Messages produced by the worker can be:
/// * Processed directly without batching.
/// * Accumulated and passed to a [`Reducer`] for batch processing.
///
/// The worker's [`Message`](Worker::Message) type must match the reducer's
/// input type when batch processing is enabled.
