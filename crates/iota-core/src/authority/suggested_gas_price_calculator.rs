/// 3. For every deferred/cancelled certificate, obtain its estimated execution
///    duration, as well as all input shared objects.
/// 4. Calculate a suggested gas price for the deferred/cancelled certificate as
///    follows:
///    - compute its (imaginary) execution start time as
///      `max_execution_duration_per_commit` minus its estimated execution
///      duration;
///    - for each input shared object, get the maximum gas price over scheduled

///    - the suggested gas price equals the maximum value obtained in the

///      maximum gas price set in the protocol.
